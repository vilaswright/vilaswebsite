                        <h1>About Me (TODO third person)</h1>
                        <p class="lead">My deepest belief is that no matter what happens to you, healing is possible — and through that healing, we can help others by offering compassion, connection, and love.</p>
                        <p>I was born on June 19, 1969, in Culver City, California, into ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) also known as the Hare Krishnas, an Eastern philosophy cult my young hippie parents had joined. My childhood stretched across the globe, but my most formative—and haunting—years were spent in the Dallas Gurukula and India. Life there was a mix of wonder and trauma, much of it in boarding schools that felt more like orphanages.</p>
                        <p>At thirteen, after surviving a brutal rape, my parents married me off. When that marriage ended, I wandered India until returning to the U.S. at sixteen. At eighteen, I had a daughter and married her father. He left when she was a year and a half. At twenty-two, I married again and had two sons. That marriage, too, was marked by abuse, and at thirty-two, I found the courage to leave.</p>
                        <p>I began a relationship with a woman—wrong person, right gender—while building a career in real estate and working to heal from my past. At forty-two, I left that relationship and began rebuilding my life on my own terms. In time, I found the love of my life—my partner, best friend, and greatest supporter. Together, we have built a thriving business and a life rooted in gratitude, compassion, and generosity. My mantra is: If you can conceive it and believe it, you can achieve it. My belief is that no matter what happens to you, you must heal yourself first, then help heal others through compassion, connection, and love.</p>
                        <p>That belief has fueled my advocacy. In October 2001, I was interviewed for Glamour magazine in connection with the groundbreaking lawsuit filed by the children of the Hare Krishna cult (ISKCON) to seek justice for survivors of abuse. On October 11, 2024, the AHA Foundation published part of my story to raise awareness about the urgent need to end child marriage. Just ten days later, on October 21, I testified before the D.C. Council in support of legislation to ban child marriage in the District. Less than two months later, on December 17, 2024, the Council voted unanimously to pass the bill, transforming years of pain, resilience, and advocacy into lasting change.</p>
                        <p>My journey has been one of survival, rebuilding, and using my voice to protect others from the harms I endured. I am living proof that no matter how deep the wound, healing is possible—and that healing can spark change far beyond yourself.</p>
